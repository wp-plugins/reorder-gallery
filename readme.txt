Allows you to reorder your gallery images.

== Description ==

Adds an "Order" field to the images in your gallery, much like pages have, which
allows you to reorder them to display in whatever order you want.  Requires PHP5.

== Installation ==

1. Verify that you have PHP5, which is required for this plugin.
1. Upload the whole `reorder-gallery` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the order? =

Each image will have an "Order" field.  The lower the number in that field, the earlier in the gallery it is.

= What if some images have the same value? =

If images have the same number, they will be ordered with the most recently added last.
